# MLend_MiniProject
Machine Learning mini-project for ECS7020P - Deception Detection using Audio Features

## Introduction
This project focuses on detecting deception in spoken audio using machine learning models. The dataset used is the MLEnd Deception Dataset.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Dataset
The dataset contains audio recordings labeled as either `True` or `Deceptive`. The aim is to classify these recordings using machine learning models.

## Methodology
- Extracted features like pitch, power, and voiced fraction.
- Trained models such as SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy metrics.

## Results
The Random Forest model provided the best performance with an accuracy of XX%.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Future Improvements
- Try deep learning models for feature extraction.
- Test the model on a larger dataset.
